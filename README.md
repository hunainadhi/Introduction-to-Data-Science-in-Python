# Introduction-to-Data-Science-in-Python
Completed a course on Coursera provided by University of Michigan

The course helped me learn data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library and the abstraction of the Series and DataFrame as the central data structures for data analysis, along with tutorials on how to use functions such as groupby, merge, and pivot tables effectively.
By the end of this course, I was able to take tabular data, clean it, manipulate it, and run basic inferential statistical analyses.

The course also consisted of a project of Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis :University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions. 

The Contents of this Hypothesis Testing can be found in the Assignment 4.ipynb
